# Library Management System API

Develop a backend API for a Library Management System that allows library staff and members to manage books, memberships, and borrowing activities. The API will be structured around CRUD operations for books, members, and borrow records, with additional endpoints for borrowing and returning books. You will use UUID for unique identification in all tables.
